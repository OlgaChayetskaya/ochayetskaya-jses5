// Arrays also come with the standard methods every and some. Both take a
// predicate function that, when called with an array element as argument, returns
// true or false. Just like && returns a true value only when the expressions on
// both sides are true, every returns true only when the predicate returns true for
// all elements of the array. Similarly, some returns true as soon as the predicate
// returns true for any of the elements. They do not process more elements
// than necessaryâ€”for example, if some finds that the predicate holds for the first
// element of the array, it will not look at the values after that.
// Write two functions, every and some, that behave like these methods, except
// that they take the array as their first argument rather than being a method.

function myEvery(array, func) {
  return array.filter(func).length === array.length;
}
function mySome(array, func) {
  return array.filter(func).length !== 0;
}
function moreThenTen(a) {
  return a > 10;
}
//console.log(myEvery([100, 3, 10000, 20, 50], moreThenTen));
//console.log(mySome([100, 11, 90, 20, 50], moreThenTen));
